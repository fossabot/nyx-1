`@nyx-discord/framework` holds the default implementations of `@nyx-discord/core`.

## ðŸ“š Introduction

This package includes the default implementations of the interfaces/types at `@nyx-discord/core`.

These implementations are also built with interfaces in mind, so every dependency of every module can be replaced with
something else, typically via constructor injection.

If a dependency is not specified, the default implementation (included here) is used.

## ðŸ“– Documentation

nyx has two documentation sources:

* [Typedoc](https://nyx-discord.github.io/nyx/typedoc), documenting classes, types and interfaces, so you can easily
  explore
  the library through your browser.
* [Docusaurus](https://nyx-discord.github.io/nyx/docs), which serves as a guide for how to use and modify the framework.
