Hello there 👋! Welcome to the Docusaurus documentation for nyx, a Discord.js Typescript bot framework.

Here, you'll discover how to create your own bot using nyx, how to customize existing and add new components to it.

:::danger
nyx is not the best fit for beginners or simple bots. We assume you have some level of understanding of Typescript and
Discord.js.

If you want something simpler, you might want to check out our bot template, `phanes`.
