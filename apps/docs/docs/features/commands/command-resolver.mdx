title: Ô∏èüîÄ Command Resolver
---

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

The `CommandResolver` is the object responsible for figuring to what command an `ApplicationCommandInteraction` or an
`AutocompleteInteraction` is trying to call. It's stored by a `CommandManager`, and you can get it
via `CommandManager#getResolver()`.

:::danger
A resolver does not locate the actual command. Instead, it returns a `CommandReferenceData` object that says data about
the command to find, like its name and type. The `CommandRepository` can then use this to actually locate the command.

This intermediary is needed to avoid the resolver depending on the repository, and thus allowing you to reuse resolvers.

## üë∑ Creation

You can create a command resolver by either:

* Extending `DefaultCommandResolver` from `@framework` (recommended).
* Implementing the `CommandResolver` interface from `@core`.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Extending DefaultCommandResolver">
```

```ts
import { DefaultCommandResolver } from '@nyx-discord/framework';

class MyCommandResolver extends DefaultCommandResolver {
  // ...
}

const myResolver = new MyCommandResolver();

const myBot = Bot.create((bot) => ({
  commands: DefaultCommandManager.create(bot, client, clientBus, { resolver: myResolver }),
}));
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Implementing CommandResolver">
```

```ts
import { CommandResolver } from '@nyx-discord/core';

class MyCommandResolver implements CommandResolver {
  // ...
}

const myResolver = new MyCommandResolver();

const myBot = Bot.create((bot) => ({
  commands: DefaultCommandManager.create(bot, client, clientBus, { resolver: myResolver }),
}));
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```
