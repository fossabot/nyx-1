title: ️💼 Command Manager
---

The `CommandManager` is the object that holds together the nyx event system.

It consists of:

* `CommandSubscriberContainer` for managing command-related subscribers.
* `CommandCustomIdProcessor` for processing command customIds.
* `CommandRouter` for routing command interactions to the respective command.
* `CommandExecutor` for executing concrete commands.
* `CommandRepository` for storing the registered commands and managing their registration at Discord.
* `EventBus` for emitting command related events.

As well as methods to interact with them.

## 👷 Creation

You can create a custom command manager by either:

* Extending `DefaultCommandManager` from `@nyx-discord/framework` (recommended).
* Implementing `CommandManager` from `@nyx-discord/core`.

Then you can pass it to your bot:

```ts
class MyCommandManager extends DefaultCommandManager {
  // highlight-next-line
  public myCustomPublicMethod() {}
}

const myBot = Bot.create((bot: NyxBot) => ({
  // ...

  // highlight-next-line
  events: new MyCommandManager(/** ... */),
}));

// highlight-next-line
myBot.commands.myCustomPublicMethod() // works!
```

The `Bot` class is able to infer the type of your custom manager via generics, so accessing any custom public method or
property will work without errors.
