title: ðŸ“” Command Repository
---

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

The `CommandRepository` is the object responsible for storing commands and their Discord.js `ApplicationCommand`
mappings, as well as adding commands at Discord using the `Client`. It's stored by a `CommandManager`, and you can get
it via `CommandManager#getRepository()`.

:::danger
It's a pending rewrite to make the `CommandRepository` only store commands, and delegate the serialization and
registration of commands to a separate object.
:::

You can't modify the repository directly since the `CommandManager` returns a `ReadonlyCommandRepository` type, but the
hidden methods are available at the `CommandManager`. This is because adding, removing and updating a command needs more
logic than just modifying the repository, and the manager is responsible for coordinating this.


## ðŸ‘· Creation

You can create a command repository by either:

* Extending `DefaultCommandRepository` from `@framework` (recommended).
* Implementing the `CommandRepository` interface from `@core`.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Extending DefaultCommandRepository">
```

```ts
import { DefaultCommandRepository } from '@nyx-discord/framework';

class MyCommandRepository extends DefaultCommandRepository {
  // ...
}

const myRepository = new MyCommandRepository();

const myBot = Bot.create((bot) => ({
  commands: DefaultCommandManager.create(bot, client, clientBus, { repository: myRepository }),
}));
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Implementing CommandRepository">
```

```ts
import { CommandRepository } from '@nyx-discord/core';

class MyCommandRepository implements CommandRepository {
  // ...
}

const myRepository = new MyCommandRepository();

const myBot = Bot.create((bot) => ({
  commands: DefaultCommandManager.create(bot, client, clientBus, { repository: myRepository }),
}));
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```
