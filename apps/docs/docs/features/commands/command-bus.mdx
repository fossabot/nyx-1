title: ðŸ“£ Command Event Bus
---

The `ScheduleEventBus` emits command related events. It's stored by a `CommandManager`, and you can get it via
`CommandManager#getEventBus()`.

Currently, these events are:

* `CommandAdd` - A top level command was added. Passes the added `TopLevelCommand`.
* `CommandRemove` - A top level command was removed. Passes the removed `TopLevelCommand`.
* `CommandUpdate` - A top level command was updated. Passes the updated `TopLevelCommand`.
* `CommandRun` - An executable command was run. Passes the `ExecutableCommand`, the `CommandExecutableInteraction` and the `CommandExecutionMeta`.
* `CommandAutocomplete` - An executable command's autocompletion was called. Passes the `ExecutableCommand`, the `CommandAutocompleteInteraction`, the `CommandExecutionMeta` and the answered `ApplicationCommandOptionChoiceData[]`.

You can get these events from the `CommandEventEnum` enum on `@core`.
