title: ğŸ“£ Schedule Event Bus
---

The `ScheduleEventBus` emits schedule related events. It's stored by a `ScheduleManager`, and you can get it via
`ScheduleManager#getEventBus()`.

You can check more information about buses on the [ğŸ“£ Event Buses](../events/event-bus) documentation.

## ğŸ‘‚ Events

Currently, the events that it emits are:

* `ScheduleAdd` - Emitted when a new `Schedule` is added. Passes the added `Schedule`.
* `ScheduleRemove` - Emitted when an `Schedule` is removed. Passes the removed `Schedule`.

You can get these events from the `ScheduleEventEnum` enum on `@core`.
