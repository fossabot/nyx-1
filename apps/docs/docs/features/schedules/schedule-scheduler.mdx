title: üîç Schedule Execution Scheduler
---

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

The `ScheduleExecutionScheduler` is the object responsible for tracking the execution of schedules. It's stored by a
`ScheduleManager`, and you can get it via `ScheduleManager#getScheduler()`.

You can't modify the scheduler directly since the `ScheduleManager` returns a `ReadonlyScheduleExecutionScheduler` type,
but the hidden methods are available at the `ScheduleManager`. This is because starting and stopping the job needs
more logic than just modifying the scheduler, and the manager is responsible for coordinating this.

## üë∑ Creation

You can create a scheduler by either:

* Extending `DefaultScheduleExecutionScheduler` from `@framework` (recommended).
* Implementing the `ScheduleExecutionScheduler` interface from `@core`.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Extending DefaultScheduleExecutionScheduler">
```

The `DefaultScheduleExecutionScheduler` has two dependencies:
* The `ScheduleExecutor` to execute schedules when needed.
* The `ScheduleTickFactory` to create a `ScheduleTickMeta` before executing a schedule.

While the default executor doesn't depend on the `NyxBot`, the tick factory does and as such it needs to be defined
inside the bot's constructor.

```ts
import { DefaultScheduleExecutionScheduler } from '@nyx-discord/framework';

class MyScheduleExecutionScheduler extends DefaultScheduleExecutionScheduler {
	// Your custom logic.
}

// Could also be any `ScheduleExecutor` implementation.
const executor = DefaultScheduleExecutor.create();

const myBot = Bot.create((bot) => {
  const tickFactory = (schedule: Schedule) => ScheduleTickMeta.fromSchedule(schedule, bot);
  const scheduler = MyScheduleExecutionScheduler.create(executor, tickFactory);

  const scheduleManager = DefaultScheduleManager.create(bot, { scheduler, executor });

  return { schedules: scheduleManager };
});
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Implementing ScheduleExecutionScheduler">
```

```ts
import { ScheduleExecutionScheduler } from '@nyx-discord/core';

class MyScheduleExecutionScheduler implements ScheduleExecutionScheduler {
	// Your custom logic.
}

const myBot = Bot.create((bot) => {
  const scheduler = new MyScheduleExecutionScheduler(/** Needed parameters */);

	return {
    schedules: DefaultScheduleManager.create(bot, { scheduler }),
	}
});
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## üß≠ Job Adapters

`ScheduleJobAdapters` are objects created by the scheduler that will tick a given schedule in the future. They
serve as an abstraction for some underlying tick object, like a `cron` job, a `setInterval()` interval, etc.

Since the job is entirely responsible for a given `Schedule`'s ticking on a given bot, stopping or destroying it will
effectively stop the schedule from being ticked.

:::note
`@framework` uses a `CronJobAdapter`, which is a `ScheduleJobAdapter` that holds a `CronJob` from the
[npm cron package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cron).
