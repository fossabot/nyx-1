The `EventManagerEventBus` emits "event manager" related events. It's stored by an `EventManager`, and you can get it
via `EventManager#getManagerBus()`.

## ğŸ‘‚ Events

Currently, the events that it emits are:

* `EventBusAdd` - Emitted when a new `EventBus` is added. Passes the added `EventBus`.
* `EventBusRemove` - Emitted when an `EventBus` is removed. Passes the removed `EventBus`.

You can get these events from the `EventManagerEventEnum` enum on `@core`.
